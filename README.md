3 simple Blender addons in one repository.

## Annotator

While Blender allows the user to draw annoations in different colors, the UI is very obscure. This addon provides extremely simple UI for this purpose:

## Bony

It's mostly for handling model imported by [DazToBlender](https://github.com/daz3d/DazToBlender).

The most noticable feature is `Reposition Bones`. Daz's model has tons of shapekeys (morphs), so the armature can be displaced after applying shapekeys. This will fix it. (Not very accurate for facial bones, so be careful.)

## Scrubby

Add ping-pong and play-to-the-end to Blender's animation system.
